,Date,Event,Significance
0,Mar 1582,Great magnetic storms of March 1582,Prolonged severe-extreme geomagnetic storm produced aurora to 28.8° magnetic latitude (MLAT) and ≈33.0° invariant latitude (ILAT).[37][38]
1,Feb 1730,,At least as intense as the 1989 event but less intense than the Carrington event[39]
2,Sep 1770,,[40][41]
3,Sep 1859,Carrington Event,"Also known as the Carrington Event, the most extreme storm ever documented by most measures; telegraph machines reportedly shocked operators and caused small fires; aurora visible in tropical areas; first solidly established connection of flares to geomagnetic disturbances. Extreme storming directly preceded this event in late August."
4,Feb 1872,,[42]
5,Nov 1882,November 1882 geomagnetic storm,[43]
6,Oct 1903,Solar storm of Oct-Nov 1903,"An extreme storm, estimated at Dst -531 nT arose from a fast CME (mean ≈1500 km/s), occurred during the ascending phase of the minimum of the relatively weak solar cycle 14, which is the most significant storm on record in a solar minimum period. Aurora was conservatively observed to ≈44.1° ILAT, and widespread disruptions and overcharging of telegraph systems occurred.[44][45]"
7,Sep 1909,Geomagnetic storm of September 1909,"Dst calculated to have reached -595 nT, comparable to the March 1989 event[46]"
8,May 1921,May 1921 geomagnetic storm,"Among most extreme known geomagnetic storms; farthest equatorward (lowest latitude) aurora ever documented; burned out fuses, electrical apparatus, and telephone station; caused fires at signal tower and telegraph station; total communications blackouts lasting several hours. A paper[47] in 2019 estimates intensity of −907±132 nT.[48]"
9,Jan 1938,January 1938 geomagnetic storm or the Fátima storm,
10,Mar 1940,,Triggered by an X35±1 solar flare[49]
11,Sep 1941,,[50]
12,Mar 1946,Geomagnetic storm of March 1946,Est. Dstm of 512 nT[51][52]
13,Feb 1956,,[53][54][55]
14,Sep 1957,Geomagnetic storm of September 1957,[56]
15,Feb 1958,Geomagnetic storm of February 1958,[56]
16,Jul 1959,Geomagnetic storm of July 1959,[56]
17,May 1967,,Blackout of polar surveillance radars during Cold War led U.S. military to scramble for nuclear war until solar origin confirmed[57]
18,Oct 1968,,[58][59]
19,Aug 1972,August 1972 solar storm,"Fastest CME transit time recorded; most extreme solar particle event (SPE) by some measures and the most hazardous to human spaceflight during the Space Age; severe technological disruptions, caused accidental detonation of numerous magnetic-influence sea mines[60]"
20,Mar 1989,March 1989 geomagnetic storm,Most extreme storm of the Space Age by several measures; outed power grid of province of Quebec
21,Aug 1989,,[61]
22,Nov 1991,Geomagnetic storm of November 1991,An intense solar storm with about half the energy output of the March 1989 storm. Aurorae were visible in the US as far south as Texas[62][63]
23,Apr 2000,,[64]
24,Jul 2000,Bastille Day solar storm,
25,Apr 2001,,"A solar flare from a sunspot region associated with this activity and preceding this period produced the then largest flare detected during the Space Age at about X20 (the first event to saturate spaceborne monitoring instruments, this was exceeded in 2003) but was directed away from Earth.[64][65]"
26,Nov 2001,Geomagnetic storm of November 2001,"A fast-moving CME triggered vivid aurorae as far south as Texas, California, and Florida[66]"
27,Oct 2003,2003 Halloween solar storms,Among top few most intense storms of the Space Age; aurora visible as far south as Texas and the Mediterranean countries of Europe. A solar flare with x-ray flux estimated to be around X45 occurred from an associated active region on 4 November but was directed away from Earth.[67][68][69][70][71]
28,Nov 2003,Solar storms of November 2003,2021 study estimated Dstm of -533 nT[51][56]
29,Jan 2005,,[72][73]
30,Sep 2017,,Triggered by an X12.9 class solar flare[74][75]
31,Feb 2022,SpaceX Starlink satellites failure,A mild solar particle and geomagnetic storm[76] led to the failure and reentry of 40 SpaceX Starlink satellites that had been recently launched and were in low Earth orbit (LEO)[77]
